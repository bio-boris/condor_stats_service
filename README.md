You can also learn more about the apps implemented in this module from its [catalog page](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/condor_stats) or its [spec file]($module_name.spec).

# Setup and test

Add your KBase developer token to `test_local/test.cfg` and run the following:

```bash
$ make
$ kb-sdk test
```

After making any additional changes to this repo, run `kb-sdk test` again to verify that everything still works.

# Architecture

* Dynamic service has a mongodb store to keep a few records. Records are expired after 600 seconds (configurable with RECORD_EXPIRY_TIME_SECONDS) and deleted.
* Dynamic service has env variables ['COLLECTOR_HOST','CONDOR_HOST','POOL_PASSWORD','SCHEDD_HOST'] in order to run run condor_q, condor_status and condor_userprio on the condor hosts.
* Two sets of ENV variables are required for appdev/prod
* Upon startup, dynamic service runs "Generate_data_dump" to dump condor_q data into service.
* A cronjob runs to generate fresh data every 5 minutes (configurable with CRONJOB_RUN_FREQUENCY_SECONDS)

# Testing
docker build . -t test/condor_stats:latest; docker run -p 5000:5000 -e AUTH_SERVICE_URL=https://ci.kbase.us/services/auth/api/legacy/KBase/Sessions/Login -e KBASE_ENDPOINT=https://ci.kbase.us/services -e KBASE_SECURE_CONFIG_PARAM_POOL_PASSWORD_CI="" test/condor_stats:latest
